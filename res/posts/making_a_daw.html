    <h1>I a planning on making a daw</h1>
    <p>
      I want to learn low level application development and music.<br>
      So to kill to birds with one stone I thought I should make a<br>
      digital audio workstation. I don't know how far I will get,<br>
      but I think it is a good goal to help me align my tinkering.<br>
      <br>
      Anyway the repository can be found
      <a href="https://github.com/it-is-zane/daw">here</a>.
