# Web Server Experiments
I use this repository to mess around with low level web technology.
It serves anything placed in the res directory and **automaticly caches** files in memory.
Text files are automaticly compressed using **brotli compression**. It also makes use of a **thread pool** to proccess requests in parallel.
